# Project_3

Project Proposal
1.	 We will be creating a geo map of crime data in LA. The map can be filtered by the following categories to give the user more detailed information on a specific group of people. The data we used was specific to charge 41.18 SITTING, LYING, OR SLEEPING OR STORING, USING, MAINTAINING, OR PLACING PERSONAL PROPERTY IN THE PUBLIC RIGHT-OF-WAY.
a.	Race
b.	Year
c.	Arrest Type (misdemeanor / infraction / other)
d.	Age
e.	Sex
f.	Time (seasons of the year)

2.	Java Script Libraries
a.	Chart.js
b.	Plotly.js
c.	Leaflet 
d.	Victory re-charts
e.	Cross filter

3.	Basic Outline of Using Libraries Together 
a.	Set Up Leaflet and Heatmap.js:  Initialize Leaflet to create the base map. Integrate Heatmap.js to add heat map functionality. Load Data and Create Heat Map:  Load your data (e.g., coordinates with intensity values). Use Heatmap.js to generate the heat map layer based on your data. Add Popups:  Use Leaflet's built-in popup functionality to display additional information when a user interacts with a data point on the map. Implement Filters:  Create custom UI elements (buttons, dropdowns, etc.) using Leaflet's controls to allow users to filter the data displayed on the map
